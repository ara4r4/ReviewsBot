      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Welcome to the Reviews Bot Terms of Service (the “ToS”). By accessing or using the Reviews Bot (the “Service”), you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these terms. If you do not agree with any part of these terms, you must cease use of the Service immediately.</p>
      
      <h2>1. Data Collection and Privacy</h2>
      <p>Reviews Bot only collects publicly available data, including but not limited to usernames and guild information. The bot does not collect or store any private data. All suggestions submitted to the bot are stored temporarily and cleared monthly for efficiency. Please be aware that Reviews Bot does not store any reviews. For further information, please refer to our <a href="privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

      <h2>2. User Responsibilities</h2>
      <p>As a user of the Reviews Bot, you are responsible for your conduct while using the Service. This includes ensuring that any content you provide via reviews or suggestions complies with these terms, as well as applicable laws and regulations. You must also comply with Discord's own Terms of Service and Community Guidelines at all times.</p>
      
      <h2>3. Prohibited Uses</h2>
      <p>Users of the Reviews Bot are strictly prohibited from engaging in the following actions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Submitting false, misleading, or inappropriate content through reviews or suggestions.</li>
        <li>Engaging in spamming, harassment, or any other form of disruptive behavior.</li>
        <li>Using the Service to upload, post, or share content that violates any third-party rights, including intellectual property rights.</li>
        <li>Attempting to hack, modify, or reverse-engineer the bot or any of its functions.</li>
        <li>Using the bot for any illegal activities, including but not limited to hate speech, harassment, or promoting violence.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>4. Content Moderation</h2>
      <p>Although Reviews Bot does not moderate reviews, the server administrators are responsible for monitoring and moderating the content posted by users. Any violation of these terms or inappropriate behavior reported by server administrators may result in action taken by the administrators, including but not limited to suspension or removal from the server.</p>
      
      <h2>5. Permissions and Data Use</h2>
      <p>By inviting the Reviews Bot to your server, you are granting it necessary permissions for its functionalities. These permissions include but are not limited to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Sending messages</li>
        <li>Embedding links</li>
        <li>Reading message history for interactions with commands</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These permissions are outlined in the bot's invite link. The bot does not request administrative privileges or the ability to moderate users.</p>
      
      <h2>6. Termination of Access</h2>
      <p>We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to the Reviews Bot if you breach any part of these terms or Discord's Terms of Service. Termination of access may occur without prior notice, and in severe cases, your server may also lose access to the Service indefinitely. Additionally, any abusive behavior, exploitation of bot vulnerabilities, or misuse of the bot will lead to immediate suspension of access.</p>
      
      <h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>Under no circumstances shall Reviews Bot, its developers, or its affiliates be liable for any damages, losses, or claims arising from the use of the Service. This includes but is not limited to any unauthorized access, use, or disclosure of data. The bot serves as a medium for submitting and posting reviews and suggestions and is not liable for user-generated content.</p>

      <h2>8. Changes to Terms of Service</h2>
      <p>These Terms of Service may be modified at any time without prior notice. Users are encouraged to review the terms regularly to ensure ongoing compliance. Your continued use of the Service after any changes indicates your acceptance of the revised terms.</p>

      <h2>9. Governing Law</h2>
      <p>This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction where the Reviews Bot developers are based. Any disputes arising from these terms shall be resolved through arbitration in the developer’s location, unless prohibited by local laws.</p>

      <h2>10. Feedback and Reporting Violations</h2>
      <p>If you encounter any violations of these terms or have suggestions to improve the bot, you are encouraged to reach out to us through our <a href="https://discord.gg/7QCvwmZH3R">support server</a>. All feedback and reports are handled with priority, and action may be taken based on severity.</p>

      <h2>11. No Waiver</h2>
      <p>Failure by Reviews Bot to enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Service shall not constitute a waiver of future enforcement of that right or provision. Any waiver or modification of these terms must be made in writing and signed by the Reviews Bot development team.</p>

      <h2>12. Severability</h2>
      <p>If any provision of these Terms of Service is found to be unenforceable or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible, and the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect.</p>

      <h2>13. Entire Agreement</h2>
      <p>These Terms of Service constitute the entire agreement between you and Reviews Bot concerning the use of the Service. They supersede all prior or contemporaneous agreements, proposals, or communications, whether written or oral, regarding the subject matter hereof.</p>
